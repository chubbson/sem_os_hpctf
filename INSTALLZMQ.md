## ØMQ installation guide by David Hauri

By wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98MQ
ØMQ (also spelled ZeroMQ, 0MQ or ZMQ) is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library aimed at use in scalable distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ØMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker. The library is designed to have a familiar socket-style API.

ØMQ is developed by a large community of contributors, founded by iMatix, which holds the domain name and trademarks. There are third-party bindings for many popular programming languages.

Im working with fedora, so im using yum install to installing packages. 

```c
yum install asciidoc
yum install xmlto
yum install pstoedit
yum install inkscape
yum install libuuid-devel
ldconfig
```

### Clone Repos

Clone some zmq repositories, probable as siblings of my rootrepsitory sem_os_hpctf

```c
cd ..
git clone git@github.com:zeromq/libzmq.git
git clone git@github.com:zeromq/czmq.git
git clone git@github.com:imatix/zguide.git
```

####Installing lowlevel zmq library

```c
cd libzmq
./autogen.sh
./configure
```

if you re runnig in following error
```c
configure: error: Package requirements (libsodium) were not met:
```

run following based on this article: https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/1274
```c
./configure --without-libsodium
make 
make install
```

checking zmq manpages
```c
man zmq
```

checking zmq version
```c
./configure --version
```

results in: 
```c
zeromq configure 4.2.0
generated by GNU Autoconf 2.69
```

#### CZMQ - High-level C Binding for ZeroMQ 
```c
cd ..
cd czmq
./autogen.sh
make
make install 
sudo ldconfig
```

checking czmq manpages
```c
man czmq
```

based on following article https://github.com/skydb/sky/issues/63
check if ld.so.conf conrains line /usr/local/lib, and add it if not
using vi or nano or whatever, adding /usr/local/lib to a new line, save and run ldconfig 
```c
sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf
# adding line /usr/local/lib to it
sudo ldconfig
```

#### test zmq
testing zmq sample hello world by starting hwserver

```c
cd ..
cd zguide
cd examples
cd C
./build all
./hwserver
```

open a new terminal and run client
```c
./hwclient
```

so 10 Hello messages should be send from client and 10 world should be sent from server which client receives

Welcome in the world of zmq
kind regards
